<h1>Assignment: Pandas Data Management</h1>
<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>Data management contains multiple steps, including data cleaning and exploratory analysis. In this project, you will showcase skill in data management using Pandas.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>You will use publicly available files. The first contains data on causes of death, while the second contains population data. Both files have state-level information for multiple years.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=1104487&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=rochester-6302122" target="_self">NCHS_-_Leading_Causes_of_Death__United_States</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ol>
<li>To demonstrate pandas skills and ability, answer these questions:
<ol>
<li>Are Americans facing increasing, decreasing, or steady likelihood of death?</li>
<li>What are the four leading causes of death for Americans?</li>
<li>Do individual states show the same four leading causes of death?</li>
<li>Are there year-by-year changes in the four leading causes of death nationwide?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use appropriately constructed and formatted tables to show results. There is no need to use visualization in this project.</li>
<li>Use population data appropriately to demonstrate your understanding of how variables are normalized/standardized.</li>
<li>Show skill in constructing a formal report using Jupyter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your formal report should contain components such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>An introduction that discusses the scope of the analysis</li>
<li>A description of data used in the analysis along with data cleaning procedures</li>
<li>Code that clearly shows how an algorithm is implemented</li>
<li>Results</li>
<li>Discussion of results and generation of insight when appropriate</li>
<li>Summary when appropriate</li>
</ul>
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>Code in a Jupyter notebook and download to an html. Print the html to a pdf that does not exceed 8 pages.</p>
<p>Submit your work to <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=1104487&amp;type=dropbox&amp;rcode=rochester-5735348" target="_self">this Assignment folder</a> by 1:00PM Eastern Time, Saturday of Week 6.</p>
