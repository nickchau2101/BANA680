<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The information presented in this syllabus is subject to expansion, change, or modification during the semester.</p>
<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course introduces students to data management and analytics in a business setting. Students learn how to formulate hypotheses, collect and manage relevant data, and use standard tools such as Python and R in their analyses. The course exposes students to structured data as well as semi- structured and unstructured data. There are no pre or co-requisites; however, instructor permission is required for students not belonging to the MS-Business Analytics or other quantitative programs such as the MS-Computational Finance, which have program-level pre- requisites in the areas of calculus, linear algebra, and programming.</p>
<h2>Course Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>After completing this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formulate business research questions and identify data analytic steps to answer them</li>
<li>Demonstrate proficiency in using Python to extract, clean and re-arrange data (including text data) for analysis</li>
<li>Use visualization in business contexts using Matplotlib or other tools to unearth relationships between variables</li>
<li>Use descriptive statistics and regressions to unearth relationships between variables</li>
</ul>
<h2>Materials &amp; Programs</h2>

<li>A computer that can handle the various programs for the course (most do). Please note that Mac computers tend to have more difficulties with some of the open source software used in the course and that almost all computers will “complain” over something or other; this is a fact of life in the computing world. Learn from the community around you to overcome these technical challenges.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>This is a 3-credit semester course. You should plan to spend 8 to 12 hours on course activities each week.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of each student to understand fully the expectations for participation for every course in which the student is enrolled. Saunders College of Business courses are not correspondence courses, nor are they self-paced. Students of the Business Analytics program are expected to participate in all dimensions of every course. Not contributing for more than a week will adversely affect one's grade. Students must log in to and interact with the course regularly.&nbsp;</p>
