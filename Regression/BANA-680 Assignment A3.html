<h1>Assignment: Data Management and Regression Analysis</h1>
<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>An important way to test the relationship between two variables <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> is to run the model: <em>Y = a + bX</em> using ordinary least squares (OLS). When we run regressions, we not only estimate the parameters <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> that can then be used for predictions, we also get to understand how well the model fits (i.e., how much of the variance in<em> Y</em> is explained by <em>a+bX</em>).</p>
<p>There are many critical issues such as the selection and measurement of the <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> variables. For example, are the variables scaled properly? How to select <em>X</em> variables?</p>
<p>Common sense and business knowledge can often guide you in the proper direction, but one also has to smartly use exploratory data analysis (EDA).<em> In this assignment, you will apply such analyses to understand the relationship between audit fees (the Y variable) and financial characteristics of a firm (the X variables).</em></p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>You are provided with data from two separate sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=1104487&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=rochester-6531359" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BANA-680 Assignment 4 OL AuditFees201019</a>&nbsp;contains audit fee information from the Audit Analytics database</li>
<li><a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=1104487&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=rochester-6531358" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BANA-680 Assignment 4 OL Compustat201019</a>&nbsp;contains financial characteristics of firms from the Compustat Annual Industrial file.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find some of the variables defined in the Compustat database:</p>
<p><img src="Compustat.jpg" alt="Screen capture of the Compuserve database" title="Screen capture of the Compuserve database" style="max-width: 75%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" /></p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ol>
<li>You are expected to conduct library research (search&nbsp;<a href="https://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.scholar.google.com</a> using keywords such as audit fees) to gain an understanding of variables affecting audit fees.</li>
<li>The main requirement is that you identify and demonstrate a model explaining audit fees (<em>Y</em>) using firm characteristics (<em>X</em>). Please use OLS.</li>
<li>Use EDA as well as business judgment to identify the best set of <em>X</em> variables. In short, demonstrate skill in feature engineering.</li>
<li>Demonstrate pandas skill and ability in data acquisition, data cleaning, data management, and analysis.</li>
<li>Demonstrate <em>advanced ability</em> in reporting using a Jupyter notebook. Recall that an analytics report has many components (see spec. sheet for previous projects as well as the list below). You are expected to showcase increasing skill in reporting as you make progress in the course.</li>
</ol>
<p>An analytics report has many components such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>An introduction that discusses the scope of the analysis</li>
<li>A description of data used in the analysis along with data cleaning procedures</li>
<li>Code that clearly shows how an algorithm is implemented</li>
<li>Results</li>
<li>Discussion of results and generation of insight when appropriate</li>
<li>Summary when appropriate</li>
</ul>
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>Submit a pdf as before. The total length should not exceed 10 pages.</p>
<p>Submit your work to <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=1104487&amp;type=dropbox&amp;rcode=rochester-5735350" target="_self">this Assignment folder</a> by 1:00PM Eastern Time, Saturday of Week 10.</p>
